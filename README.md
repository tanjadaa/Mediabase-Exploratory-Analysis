# Mediabase-Exploratory-Analysis
Mediabase is a music industry service that monitors radio station airplay in 180 US and Canadian markets. By using Tableau I analyzed trends and insights from "Top 40" Playlist. 

## What is "Top 40" - The Music Industry 
In the music industry, the "Yop 40" is the current, 40 most-popular songs in a particular genre. It is the best-selling or most frequently broadcast popular music. Record charts have traditionally consisted of a total of 40 songs. "Top 40" or "contemporary hit radio" is also a radio format which is what is referred to here from Mediabase.

Starting with the Rank of a song the current week 'This week' vs its 'Last week' which can indicate any major changes and we can cleary see that majority of the songs rank between 50-200. 

As the dataset consists of 5000+ entries, trimming it down to the top 200 to make the visualization more feasable and understandable as the bigger trends occur from ranking below 100.

Thereafter, I discovered more of the popular artists tend to have more song entries in "Top 40"
