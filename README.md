# Mediabase-Exploratory-Analysis
Mediabase is a music industry service that monitors radio station airplay in 180 US and Canadian markets. By using Tableau I analyzed trends and insights from "Top 40" Playlist. 

## What is "Top 40" - The Music Industry 
In the music industry, the "Yop 40" is the current, 40 most-popular songs in a particular genre. It is the best-selling or most frequently broadcast popular music. Record charts have traditionally consisted of a total of 40 songs. "Top 40" or "contemporary hit radio" is also a radio format which is what is referred to here from Mediabase.

Starting with the Rank of a song the current week 'This week' vs its 'Last week' which can indicate any major changes and we can cleary see that majority of the songs rank between 50-200. 

As the dataset consists of 5000+ entries, trimming it down to the top 200 to make the visualization more feasable and understandable as the bigger trends occur from ranking below 100.

Thereafter, I discovered more of the popular artists tend to have more song entries in "Top 40" and is usually also associated with a major label which we will see on a later discovery.

An interesting finding and a contradiction to the famous saying 'The more the merrier' is that the more radio stations a song is on does not necessarily correlate with a higher ranking in terms of how many times a song is being played, hence increasing its overall popularity. 

   Examples we can see here is Post Malone "Goodbyes" f/ Young Thug which ranks #13 but has lesser stations than the 3 songs behind "Loose you to love me", "Graveyard" and "Liar".

## "The big 3"

Moving on to the treemap, based on the sum of the number a song has been played and we see that major labels, as incicated that are a part of "The Big 3". The big 3 record labels are Sony BMG, Universal Music Group (UMG) and Warner Music Group (WMG) which again has it's smaller internal companies under their umbrella such as Atlantic Records, Interscope and Republic etc.) 

Here we see that they make up majority of the chart and as these labels already have a well established reputation they also tend to dominate the Top 40 chart which their capabilites and resources such as marketing and PR as big driving forces. We see a high correlation with many big artists are also associated with major record labels as shown.
